The goal of chapter 6 was to learn about anoother data structure in python called dictionary.  
Instead of index in list or tuple, key was used to access data(value in dictionary).  
So, key is not editable and cannot be duplicated.  

The goal of chapter 7 was to learn how to use function and module.  
module contained functions that I defined.  
After importing the module, I could call the functions in module.
