The goal of this exercise is to learn about numpy library for data analysis.  
In other language, data in array should be used with iteration.  
But, numpy directly supported arithmetic operations to arrays like doing arithmetic operations with variables. (Still, dimension of array should be same)
Also, boolean indexing helped finding data easier.
