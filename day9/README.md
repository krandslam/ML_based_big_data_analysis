The goal of chapter 4 was to learn about data structures in python, which are list and tuple.  
The difference between list and tuple was that tuple cannot be modified after declaration.  
So, only searching value is available for tuple after declaration.  
But, list can add, delete, search, edit data.  

The goal of chapter 5 was to learn about iteration in python.  
for and while loop were used.
